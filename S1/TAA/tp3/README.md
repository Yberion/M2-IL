# Gradle

Run ``gradle build``

## hsqldb

Download the last version here : http://hsqldb.org/ and place it under the folder ``hsqldb``.

Start the ``hsqldb`` server by running ``hsqldb/run_server.sh/bat``.

You can display the current state of any DB using the GUI tool by running ``hsqldb/GUI_hsqldb.sh/bat``.

Connect to the DB :

- User : ``SA``
- Password : ````
- URL : ``jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/test``

To remove all existing DB remove all ``test.*`` files.

## Spring boot

You have to start the ``HSQLDB`` server (well, not needed for the first and second part of the TP).

### Part 1 & 2

To start the application run ``gradle bootRun``/``gradle run``, you can also run the application through Eclipse, right click on ``Tp3Application.java`` -> ``Run As -> Java Application``.

The AOP is used on all methods within ``part1_2.*.implementation.*`` java files for the logging system (just a print for the test), there's also @Around used on all methods within ``part1_2.bank.implementation.*`` java files.

I'm using constructors for dependencies injection instead of ``@Autowired``.

### Part 3

On this part, since there's "lot" of things involved, I am using [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) and [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/) (I could use [JMapper](https://github.com/jmapper-framework/jmapper-core) as well, but it's not maintained anymore?).
Check [Performance of Java Mapping Frameworks](https://www.baeldung.com/java-performance-mapping-frameworks).

For ``Lombok`` you need to [install the plugin](https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse) on your IDE using the ``.jar``. ``Lombok 1.18.14`` is currently broken on Eclipse https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/2599, download the [version 1.18.12](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.projectlombok%20AND%20a:lombok&core=gav).

For ``MapStruct`` you need to [install the plugin](https://mapstruct.org/documentation/ide-support/) on your IDE.
