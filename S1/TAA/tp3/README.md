# Gradle

Run ``gradle build``

## hsqldb

Download the last version here : http://hsqldb.org/ and place it under the folder ``hsqldb``.

Start the ``hsqldb`` server by running ``hsqldb/run_server.sh/bat``.

You can display the current state of any DB using the GUI tool by running ``hsqldb/GUI_hsqldb.sh/bat``.

Connect to the DB :

- User : ``SA``
- Password : 
- URL : ``jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/test``

To remove all existing DB remove all ``test.*`` files.

## Spring boot

You have to start the ``HSQLDB`` server (well, not needed for the first and second part of the TP).

### Part 1 & 2

To start the application run ``gradle bootRun``/``gradle run``, you can also run the application through Eclipse, right click on ``Tp3Application.java`` -> ``Run As -> Java Application``.

The AOP is used on all methods within ``part1_2.*.implementation.*`` java files for the logging system (just a print for the test), there's also @Around used on all methods within ``part1_2.bank.implementation.*`` java files.

I'm using constructors for dependencies injection instead of ``@Autowired``.
