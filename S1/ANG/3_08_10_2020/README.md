What we did:

Choose a topic:

- -> Cyber security vocabulary
- -> Phrasal verb
	- Take out (verb + pr√©position): 1. Kill/eliminate/destroy, 2. physically take something out, "go out with your girlfriend"
- Formal / Informal writing

We use Kahoot to make some "games" related to those topics.

Today's work:

- Read "Basic Grammar Checklist"
- Finish the first draft
- Pair with someone and exchange our VET and evaluate it with "VET (1.1) Good and Bad - Evaluation..."
